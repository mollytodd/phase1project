## CountryCraze

## Purpose:
This is an app for users to search for a country that they would like to know more information about. The data points include: population, languages, flag, capital, currency + symbol, region, and size in KM
## As a user, I can:
* search for a country (case in sensitive)
* hover over the 'coat of arms' to see what the design is
* click delete to remove from page
* save country to 'saved countries section.' when user refreshes the page, the saved countries will be available on the top right
